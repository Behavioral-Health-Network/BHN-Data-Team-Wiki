# Tags Index

This file outlines current and potential tags used across the wiki. Tagging conventions are subject to revision based on team feedback and content needs.

## Tag Structure Guidelines
- **Tags should be action-oriented or thematic** (e.g., `data-modeling`, `exception-logic`, `training-notes`)
- **Avoid ambiguity** — prefer `cohort-tracking` over `tracking`
- **Use kebab-case for consistency**
- **Cross-reference program-specific vs. universal tags in relevant content**

## Example Tags (Proposed)

| Tag             | Description                              | Linked Pages               |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `data-governance` | Standards, policies, and best practices | [`docs/governance.md`](docs/governance.md) |
| `sql-comment-style` | Commenting guidelines and changelog practice | [`docs/styleguide.md`](docs/styleguide.md) |
| `power-bi-modeling` | DAX logic, time intelligence, and auditability | [`analytics/beacn-metrics.md`](analytics/beacn-required-metrics.md) |
| `onboarding`      | Assets useful for new contributors      | [`docs/onboarding.md`](docs/onboarding.md) |
