# Program Documentation Overview

This folder contains Data Team-facing documentation of program-specific workflows, goals, and policies. Its primary purpose is to preserve institutional memory around decisions made during the development and refinement of these processes, especially those with implications for data reporting, cross-team coordination, and long-term sustainability.

While program leadership maintains their own documentation, this space is intended to help the Data Team:

- Understand how each program operates in practice
- Support program teams with accurate, context-aware data products
- Report on program outcomes with clarity and historical grounding

## Folder Structure

The following subfolders correspond to specific programs or cross-program documentation:

- [`/bcr-program-docs/`](./bcr-program-docs/)
- [`/complex-care-program-docs/`](./complex-care-program-docs/)
- [`/cross-program-docs/`](./cross-program-docs/)
- [`/epicc-program-docs/`](./epicc-program-docs/)
- [`/ere-program-docs/`](./ere-program-docs/)
- [`/yere-program-docs/`](./yere-program-docs/)

Each folder may contain workflows, decision logs, policy references, and metadata schemas relevant to that program.

## Scope of Documentation

Examples of workflows and logic captured here include:

- Program enrollment and dismissal criteria
- Assignment and transfer of clients between outreach workers
- Referral pathways to external agencies
- Reconnection logic for clients already engaged in behavioral health services

Documentation may include dates, rationale, and decision history to support auditability and contributor onboarding.
