# ERE Enrollment Dismissal Process

## Description

Documents the process for dismissing ERE program enrollments.

## Dismissal Process At Referral

Enrollments for clients who are not determined eligible and clients who choose not to engage despite being eligible for ERE program participation should be dismissed promptly by Data Team staff entering the enrollment on `PROVIDERPLACEMENT`. One of the following dismissal reasons should be selected:

| Dismissal Reason                  | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Administrative        | Definition TBD        |
| AnswerFirst Determined Ineligible | AnswerFirst determines that the client is ineligible due to residency outside of the service area or due to the fact that the client has private insurance.          |
| Client Declined               | Client declined services at any point in the referral and outreach process. This is for clients who actively communicate that they don’t want to receive/continue outreach services.      |
| CMHC Determined Ineligible        | Client’s status changes such that they cease to meet program eligibility criteria. Could include:<ul><li>Moving out of our program catchment area</li><li>Admitted to long-term residential or detention facility</li><li>Any other criteria that make them ineligible for ERE services</li></ul> |
| Reconnect    | Client has an existing team at a CMHC OR is already consistently receiving services.         |
| Transfer To Compass      | Client is dismissed because they were transferred to Compass for care.         |
| Transfer To DM3700       | Client is dismissed because they were transferred to DM3700 for care.           |

## Dismissal Process When There Has Been No Client Contact

- Outreach Liaisons are to continue intensive phone outreach for 6-7 weeks (~45 days) after the point of last contact, calling ~2 times per week and trying various numbers before initiating a program enrollment dismissal.
- If there is no response by the end of this interval, the Outreach Liaison is to discuss the matter with their agency supervisor, the ERE Regional Coordinator, and the Complex Care Specialist.
- If the decision reached is that dismissal is warranted, the Outreach Liaison is to do the following:
  - Update the latest FAMCare Pathway Event form for the client.
  - Update the ERE Client Needs form the status of each documented client need (e.g., 'Referred To Or Engaged With Resources', 'Need Met Or Stable At Three Months', and/or 'Need Met Or Stable At Six Months').
  - Submit an enrollment dismissal request via encrypted email to the BHN ERE Program Manager with a carbon copy to the ERE Regional Coordinator and the Complex Care Specialist with the following information:
    - client name
    - DOB
    - FAMCare client number
    - date of dismissal
    - dismissal reason.
