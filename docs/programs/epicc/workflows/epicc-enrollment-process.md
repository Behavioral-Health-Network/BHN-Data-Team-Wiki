# EPICC Enrollment Workflow

This document outlines the enrollment responsibilities and logic for the EPICC program.  
It excludes dismissal procedures, which are now delegated to the EPICC program managers.

---

## Enrollment Roles and Access

- **Enrollment Creation & Assignment**  
  Laura and the Data Team initiate client enrollment by:  
  - Creating the enrollment record  
  - Entering referral details  
  - Assigning a Program Worker (Coach)

- **Coach Access Limits**  
  Coaches do **not** require edit access to the Enrollment form (`PROVIDERPLACEMENT`).  
  Their workflow focuses on Pathway and treatment documentation via summation forms.

---

## Agency Attribution

- The **Agency** field on `PROVIDERPLACEMENT` reflects the employer of the assigned Coach.  
- **Treatment Agency** details are **not** recorded in the enrollment form.  
  Instead, they are captured in the **Active Treatment Agency Summation**, accessed via Pathway Forms.

## Program Worker Reassignment

When a client is reassigned to a new Coach:

- Managers update the Program Worker assignment by:  
  1. Adding an **end date** to the current workerâ€™s entry  
  2. Creating a **new row** for the incoming Coach

This preserves historical assignment data while ensuring operational continuity.
