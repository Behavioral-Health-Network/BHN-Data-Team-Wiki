Supports exception reporting by flagging potential duplicate or erroneous referral entries. | System Administrator, GVT, BCR Managers | SSMS, Quick Report | [SQL](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/code/exception-reports/bcr-multiple-referrals-per-enrollment.sql) &#124; [Doc](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/docs/exception-reports/bcr-multiple-referrals-per-enrollment.md) |
| Exception Reports | BCR Pathway Added Client Never Enrolled | This exception report identifies cases where a client has been added to one or more Pathways without first being enrolled in a program. Pathway assignments should be made using the `PROVIDERPLACEMENT` form, but this report highlights instances where the assignment was incorrectly made using the `CLIENT` form. | System Administrator, GVT, BCR Managers | SSMS, Quick Report | [SQL](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/code/exception-reports/bcr-pathway-added-client-never-enrolled.sql) &#124; [Doc](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/docs/exception-reports/bcr-pathway-added-client-never-enrolled.md) |

| Exception Reports | Clients With Multiple Active Enrollments | Flags clients with more than one active enrollment at the same time, regardless of program. | System Administrator, GVT | SSMS, Quick Report | [SQL](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/code/exception-reports/clients-with-multiple-active-enrollments.sql) &#124; [Doc](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/docs/exception-reports/clients-with-multiple-active-enrollments.md) |
| Exception Reports | Clients With Multiple Active Pathways | Identifies clients who are assigned to more than one active Pathway at the same time. | System Administrator, GVT | SSMS, Quick Report | [SQL](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/code/exception-reports/clients-with-multiple-active-pathways.sql) &#124; [Doc](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/docs/exception-reports/clients-with-multiple-active-pathways.md) |
| Exception Reports | Clients With Multiple Pathways Sharing Same Start Date | Identifies clients who have multiple active Pathways that share the same start date. This helps surface potential data entry errors or structural duplication in Pathway assignment workflows. | System Administrator, GVT | SSMS, Quick Report | [SQL](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/code/exception-reports/clients-with-multiple-pathways-sharing-same-start-date.sql) &#124; [Doc](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/docs/exception-reports/clients-with-multiple-pathways-sharing-same-start-date.md) |
| Exception Reports | EPICC Duplicate PWY Forms Per Enrollment | | System Administrator, GVT, EPICC Managers | SSMS, Quick Report | [SQL](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/code/exception-reports/epicc-duplicate-pwy-forms-per-enrollment.sql) &#124; [Doc](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/docs/exception-reports/epicc-duplicate-pwy-forms-per-enrollment.md) |
| Exception Reports | EPICC IC Opioids of Use Hidden Fields Null | Flags Initial Contact records where the JavaScript function `updateReportFields()` failed to execute, resulting in missing binary values for opioid use fields. These cases suggest that `EPICC_OPIOIDS_OF_USE` was selected, but the pivoted fields (`OPIOID_OF_USE_*`) remain `NULL`. Affected records retain values in `EPICC_OPIOIDS_OF_USE` but show `NULL` in one or more corresponding pivot fields, leading to incomplete or misleading data downstream. | System Administrator, GVT | SSMS, Quick Report | [SQL](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/code/exception-reports/epicc-ic-opioids-of-use-hidden-fields-null.sql) &#124; [Doc](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/docs/exception-reports/epicc-ic-opioids-of-use-hidden-fields-null.md) |
| Exception Reports | EPICC IC PWY Date Outside Same Day Enrollment Range | Flags EPICC Initial Contact records where the enrollment start and end dates are identical, but the pathway date differs. The business rule conveyed to the Recovery Coaches is that they should always record the Initial Contact Pathway Date as the date that shows for this event on the Master Pathway Dashboard. Since the dashboard always shows End Dates, this is one day outside of the enrollment start and end range for enrollments that are opened and closed on the same day to allow for an already active enrollment to remain open. Changing the Pathway Date for the Initial Contact to be the same date as the enrollment start date will correct duplication in PATHWAYEVENTCLIENT in almost every instance. One known exception to this is instances where the Initial Contact for a same day enrollment is missing. Pathways module will consider the Initial Contact for the active enrollment to satisfy this Pathway Event. If possible, the missing Initial Contact should be entered. Failing that, we will have to filter out Initial Contacts with PATHWAY_DATE <> ENROLLMENT_STARTING_DATE in R to remove duplicates unless and until GVT offers a substantial fix for the structural defect in the Pathways Module. | System Administrator, GVT, EPICC Managers | SSMS, Quick Report | [SQL](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/code/exception-reports/epicc-ic-pwy-date-outside-same-day-enrollment-range.sql) &#124; [Doc](https://github.com/behavioral-health-network/famcare-sql-toolkit/blob/main/docs/exception-reports/epicc-ic-pwy-date-outside-same-day-enrollment-range.md) |
