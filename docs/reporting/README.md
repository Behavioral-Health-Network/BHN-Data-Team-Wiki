# Reporting Documentation

This folder contains standards that govern BHN Data Team reporting practices as well as reports and assets lists and a report request tracker. It serves both as a policy reference and a contributor workspace.

## Folder Purpose

- Define SQL-based reporting conventions for FAMCare and related platforms
- Maintain an audit trail of reporting updates and rationale
- Support collaboration

## Key Markdown Files

- [Reporting Request Tracker](reporting-request-tracker.md) â€” Change log and contributor history (editable only by designated maintainers)
- [FAMCare Reports & SQL Assets](famcare-reports-and-assets.md) - Documentation of FAMCare Reports and other assets, including report descriptions, access permissions by role, publication status, and notes
- [Quick Reports Overview](quick-reports-overview.md) - Documentation of the primary categories used for classifying Quick Reports and SQL queries authored by the Data Team.
- [Saving and Securing Quick Reports](saving-and-securing-quick-reports.md) - Documentation on the technical requirements for saving FAMCare Quick Reports and assigning security groups to control visibility.

## Contribution Guidance

Contributors may:

- Propose updates via pull request
- Use kebab-case for new files with clear, scoped naming
