# R Scripts Archive

This folder contains R scripts and Python scripts under consideration for adoption into the BHN Data Teamâ€™s tooling ecosystem. Scripts may support diagnostics, parsing, visualization, or documentation scaffolding.

Scripts here are:

- **Exploratory**: Not yet part of production workflows
- **Annotated**: Include comments for clarity and auditability
- **Modular**: Designed for potential reuse or adaptation

Please review and tag any scripts that are ready for pilot or refinement.

## Status Tags

- **Draft**: Work in progress, not yet finalized
- **Pilot**: Ready for testing in a real-world scenario
- **Ready**: Tested and approved for production use
- **Deprecated**: No longer in use, kept for reference

## Changelog

- **2025-09-18**: Adds frontmatter.
- **2025-08-03**: Adds `scripts/` folder to `assets/` and begins the process of adding content, including a draft of an R parser script. This content may grow to include Python scripts as well. This is very much under construction and subject to change.
